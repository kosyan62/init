This project is an introductory exercise in system and network administration, completed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It focuses on mastering fundamental Unix/Linux system operations, basic networking, and shell scripting through practical command-line tasks.

The project is designed to build essential system administration skills, including network diagnostics, system monitoring, process management, and user management.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** System & Network Administration
- **Platform:** macOS (network tasks) and Debian (system & scripting tasks)
- **Focus Areas:** 
  - Network tools and diagnostics
  - System operations and services
  - Shell scripting for automation
- []

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts, with each section stored in its corresponding folder:
- `network/` — Network-related tasks
- `system/` — System-level operations
- `scripts/` — Custom shell scripting exercises

Each answer or script is saved in a numbered file according to its corresponding question (e.g., `network/01`).
